<h1>History of Fishing</h1>

<h2>The First Fishermen</h2>

<p>
Archaeological excavations have revealed fish fossils that seem to show Homo habilis and later Homo erectus were the first fishermen, approximately 500,000 years ago.
Despite this, fishing likely truly advanced only after the arrival of Homo sapiens during the Upper Paleolithic period between 40,000 and 10,000 years BCE.
Subsistence fishing in that time period consisted of fishing by hand or by using basic tools. In Egypt, around 3500 BCE, the rod, line, net, and spear, seem to have 
arrived at almost the same time.

<h2>Ancient Greece and Rome</h2> 

<p>
In Graeco-Roman Antiquity, fishing was the primary subject of the Halieutika, the first surviving treatise on sea fishing, created by the poet Oppian of Corycus.
The Romans used and traded many of the resources from the Mediterranean Basin. They primarily fished by utilizing different kinds of nets. Fish that was not eaten
right away was fermented and turned into garum, a popular condiment. This was done because the concept of refrigeration had not been invented yet.

<h2>Middle Ages</h2> 

<p>
Feudal lords controlled the lakes and rivers in the Middle Ages of Europe. River fishing was tightly regulated and was allowed for people in religious communities whose 
diets had intervals of fasting. From the middle of the 11th century, the building of ponds developed, signaling the start of fish farming. Starting in the 15th century,
deep-water sea fishing and the fish market grew. The Dutch formed groups of herring drifters, which dragged a long drift net and could stay at sea for several 
consecutive weeks. They were resupplied by cargo boats known as ventjagers which also took the fish back to land.

<h2>17th Century - 20th Century</h2>

<p>
In Great Britain, the earliest trawlers arrived in the 17th century, but trawling grew quickly in the 19th century when steam power replaced sails. The small English town 
of Grimsby turned into one of the major hubs of commercial fishing in Europe and was linked by a direct railway line to London's Billingsgate Fish Market (the largest fish market in the world then).
In both World Wars, some trawlers were modified to be used to sweep underwater mines and were armed to defend the group of fishermen from enemy vessels. 
As for sport fishing, in the 18th century fly fishing was at first reserved for the rich. It slowly became more affordable as technological developments meant better gear could be 
made relatively inexpensively. To satisfy fishermen, non-native species were even added into specific areas, as was the case with trout in Australia.
