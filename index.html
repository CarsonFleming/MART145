      <h3>5-Page Website:</h3>
	  <p>
      This website started out as a single webpage about techniques used in fishing, which is one of my interests. From there, it expanded to five total pages. Four of these were for topics related to fishing, while the fifth was a home page with links to the other four.
	  After that, I created an external stylesheet and linked it to each page to give them some color, change font-family and size, and more. One of the last things I did for this website, was cropping, resizing, and saving the images from the site so I did not have to worry
	  about them becoming unavailable on the internet later or relying on HTML sizing. Designing this website helped me learn the basics of HTML as well as some CSS. I learned about tags like head, body, h1-h6, p, a, and more. It also taught me about cropping, resizing, and saving images
	  and how it can be useful.

      <h3>Bootstrap Website:</h3>
      <p>
	  My Bootstrap website started with a theme template from W3 Schools. After I studied the code, I began to make some changes. I changed things such as background-colors, font sizes, and the columns near the bottom of the page. I also added some text about myself to each section of the page.
	  One thing I added to this website that the template did not have was a registration form. The form consists of input fields for a first name, last name, and email address, as well as a submit button. It is linked to a page that should display the names and email address you entered once you click the submit button. 
	  One of the most recent updates I have done to my Bootstrap website was deleting the internal stylesheet from its main file after I moved most of it to an external stylesheet and linked it to the file. Building this website helped teach me about Bootstrap and input forms. With Bootstrap, I learned about different aspects
	  like grids and how to change the shapes of images. For input forms, I learned about many different input controls like text, email, radio, and tel.

      <h3>Slideshow (new):</h3>
      <p>
	  There were three major steps for making this slideshow. First, I wrote the HTML code. This section contained the code for each individual slide, such as the image url, caption, and slide number. Next, I wrote the CSS code in an external stylesheet. This contained descriptions of each class in the HTML section to tell the browser 
	  how to display the slideshow. Third, I added some JavaScript. This allows the user to cycle between each image. For my slideshow, I decided to use pictures of the capital cities of four different European countries. Creating this slideshow may have helped me learn more about some HTML attributes and their purposes. 
	  These included attributes like onclick, cursor, and transition.
